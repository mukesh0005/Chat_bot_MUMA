On 10th April morning, I checked the waitlist position as 6, and on Apr 11th the Waitlist position was 7. I observed that the waitlist position has changed from 6 to 7. So to confirm that there is a change I took a screenshot of the same. But surprisingly today (Apr 11) in the evening the Waitlist position - was changed from 7 to 8. Please find the screenshots of waitlist positions 7 and 8 below. I am really worried that I won't get a seat for this course. I am interested in taking warehousing course because my goal is to land a job in Engineering roles and I would like to know much more about how the data is collected and stored in data warehouses before they were processed and loaded into Databases. I am eagerly waiting for this course to be registered for summer 2023 since the same course was not offered in Fall 2023, also I am planning to graduate in Fall 2023 so I would like to take 2 courses in the summer.

       " '\\'question000001\\': \\'To Whom It May Concerns, I hope this email finds you well. My name is  An Nguyen (U# as USF undergraduate: U08015717), and I just graduated from USF last Spring 2022 from the BS-BAIS program. At the moment, I\\'m currently on my OPT and working as an FTE for Masonite corporation, located in Ybor, while applying to USF\\'s MS-BAIS program in Fall 2023. After a thorough discussion with Dr.  (Dr. B), he has encouraged me to apply to the program to best utilize my current visa status while maintaining my presence in the U.S., and I was super excited for the opportunity to be back at USF so soon as well as join the classes with some of my peers who are also joining this Fall. However, I just received some bad news on my side yesterday morning from MS BAIS Admissions. Apparently, I have been waitlisted for the program and at this point, I\\'m quite confused as to why the decision was made since the email came without a personalized reason. I\\'m not sure if this is correct but, with my application being submitted sometime late in May, I was assuming that the decision had been made because my application has been processed as an International application while the international application deadlines have long passed. As I contacted Dr. B about this matter, he assumed the same reason since requirement-wise, I really can\\'t see the reasons for the decision. Dr. B then further advised me to mitigate the situation by reaching back out to MS BAIS Admissions and reconfirming that, although my application is International as I am still an international student, I have already been in the U.S. on a student visa (F-1 OPT) with a valid I-20, and I simply need a \"Change of Level\" from the UGA to GA program. Therefore, to his point, I should be considered equivalent to domestic students, whose application deadline is July 1st. Would anyone be able to confirm if this is the case or, unfortunately, shed light on why my application has been waitlisted? And if I were indeed waitlisted because I did not meet the requirement, when should I be expecting the final notification on if I were to be offered a spot or not?

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for approving my registration for the DIS course, which I am eagerly looking forward to. However, I encountered a setback while registering for the other two courses I mentioned, EIS and Warehousing. Unfortunately, I was unable to secure a spot in these courses during the registration period. As I am scheduled to graduate by the end of Fall 2023, it is crucial for me to complete these core subjects in order to fulfill my academic requirements. These courses align perfectly with my academic and career goals in data analysis, and I believe they will provide me with essential knowledge and skills. I kindly request your assistance in helping me secure assignments for EIS and Warehousing, if possible. If there are any alternative sections, waitlists, or any other recommendations you can provide, I would be more than willing to consider them. Additionally, I would like to inquire if there are any prerequisites or additional requirements that I need to fulfill in order to become eligible for these courses. I am committed to providing any necessary documentation or information to complete the registration process successfully. Thank you for your understanding and for considering my request.

       " \"'question000001': 'Sir, I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request course registration adjustment for the first semester Fall 2023. I would like to drop one class with CRN No 80145 and add two additional subjects with CRN No's 80127(Mining) and 80125 (Advanced Systems Analysis & Design) to my schedule. Firstly, I would like to drop the class with CRN No 80145 which is Mining. Upon further consideration, I realized that there is no significant time gap between this class 80145 (Mining) and the subsequent class I wanted to enroll in with CRN No 80125 ( Advanced Systems Analysis & Design ). This gap has created scheduling conflicts and has made it challenging for me to effectively manage my time and commitments. Therefore, I believe it would be more beneficial for me to drop this class with CRN no 80145( Mining ) and seek an alternative class with CRN 80127 ( Mining ) that aligns better with my schedule. Considering this, I would like to add two subjects to my schedule. The first subject is with CRN No 80127 which focuses on data mining. Adding this subject will create a more cohesive schedule. Additionally, I would like to add the subject with CRN No 80125 ( Advanced Systems Analysis & Design ). By enrolling in this subject, I will be able to explore another area of interest that complements my program of study. Importantly, adding this subject will create a more balanced schedule and allow for an appropriate time difference between my fourth subject with CRN 80125 and the data mining class with CRN 80127. This will enable me to fully engage and excel in both courses without feeling overwhelmed. I have reviewed the course descriptions, prerequisites, and time schedules for both subjects, and I am confident that these adjustments will enhance my learning experience and contribute positively to my academic progress. I understand that any changes to my class schedule are subject to availability and approval. I kindly request your assistance in facilitating these adjustments.

I am writing to express my interest in pursuing an MS degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems at the University of South Florida, as well as a request for funding or a graduate assistantship. I would like to take this opportunity to tell you about my background, my profile, the need for this degree, my eligibility for a graduate assistantship, and my financial constraints. I am from a small and beautiful country, Nepal. I studied at a community school in my hometown and came third in class 10th, a school-leaving examination. Something I am very proud of is that I am the first computer engineer from my hometown, and I want to take this further by achieving an MS degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems at the University of South Florida. I am highly motivated to work on the application of deep learning to big data analytics and find solutions to the challenges involved. As deep learning can be utilized in big data to address problems such as extracting complex patterns from massive volumes of data, semantic indexing, data tagging, fast information retrieval, and simplifying discriminative tasks, it can bring breakthroughs in big data research. Though deep learning has been utilized in speech recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed in order to fully utilize deep learning in big data analytics. I would like to work on issues such as scalability, interpretability, and security so that we can fully harness the power of deep learning in big data analytics. I will be very thrilled and excited to work on these amazing research areas related to the program. My background includes a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. To be honest, though my overall CGPA was not the best due to university calendar issues, the 2015 earthquake, the border blockade, and other reasons, I got an A in artificial intelligence. After completing my bachelor’s degree, I kicked off my career in the fields of data engineering, data warehousing, data analysis, and business intelligence. I was involved in some pioneering projects in the business intelligence domain in Nepal's private sector. Over the past five years, I have worked on numerous data-related projects of different magnitudes, and especially while working in a bank and at Alibaba Group's e-commerce, an immensely data-driven company with big data technology, I have acquired tremendous knowledge in the field. I am interested in pursuing an MS degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems at the University of South Florida because of the international exposure and education it would provide, which I seriously need at this point in my career, as well as the fact that big data analytics is the new revolution that will take humanity to new levels. Despite being a country with a low economy, there are many MNCs operating in that utilize big data and futuristic technologies such as AI, and this will only increase in the coming years. Moreover, I believe my degree would be of great value for my home country, where data-driven decision-making is still in its infancy. After completing the program, I plan to work as an educator, sharing my knowledge and expertise with the next generation of data enthusiasts. I believe I am an excellent fit for a graduate assistantship because I have a related degree in computer engineering and have gained not exactly the same but similar experience over the past five years in the data sector. More specifically, I have a very good knowledge of academic research writing. I have taken 20+ hours of courses related to research methods and approaches. Additionally, having lived in different parts of the country as a student and a worker and transacted with people from all walks of life, I possess strong communication, collaboration, and leadership skills. I am a proficient user of English with demonstrated IELTS Academic CEFR level C1. As I truly believe in lifelong learning, I have completed various courses related to IT, business, and management that would definitely add value while working as a graduate assistant. Moreover, I have also taken extensive and specific courses related to the program, such as for Science and Learning Bootcamp, SPSS Statistics Essential Training, and many others. Unfortunately, I am facing financial challenges as I do not come from a very strong financial background, and my savings were spent on funding my brother’s education. Therefore, I am seeking opportunities for funding or a graduate assistantship that would enable me to pursue my dream of obtaining an MS degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems. I would be very grateful if you could guide me in securing one of the funding sources, and after that, I will be able to move forward confidently with my university application. I am fully aware that a graduate assistantship requires a significant amount of learning and extra hours of hard work. However, I am dedicated and determined to put in the effort.

I was asked to reach out to Prof.  from the MS of BAIS team about my application. I got accepted to the MS in BAIS Program at USF for 2022 as I was completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in USF. As I got offered a job in the field, I had to step away from the university for a little to gain experience in the tech field. Currently, I am planning to join USF for the MS in BAIS program. I was wondering if my previous application can be used as I have already been accepted, or if I need to reapply. I know the deadline for international students are in February, but as I am already situated in the United States, I do not need extra time for VISA purposes (just the I-20 will suffice if accepted). I really prefer to start in Fall 2023 if there are seats available, but if not then I will look towards Spring 2024. That being said, I hope you can consider my application in the MS in BAIS program. I have already been a part of USF throughout my undergraduate program and have had multiple opportunities working with professors and being a TA, which has helped me grow a lot. Now, I want to join back and pursue my passion in the tech field along with the business values. I have been accepted in a few other schools but my heart belongs to USF. Please let me know if anything can be done or additional information is required from my end. I look forward to hearing back from you soon. Best Regards   U72881435', 'response000002': 'Hi, Thank you for this. We unfortunately have no seats left for the Fall, and it looks as if we are full for Spring 2024 as well. The best recommendation is that you apply for Fall 2024. Clearly, given that we admitted you before and that, by that time, you will have 2 years of professional experience, the chances that you will be admitted will be very high. I am sure that this is not what you wanted to hear but it is what it is. Han'\",\n",

I was asked to reach out to Prof.  from the MS of BAIS team about my application. I got accepted to the MS in BAIS Program at USF for 2022 as I was completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in USF. As I got offered a job in the field, I had to step away from the university for a little to gain experience in the tech field. Currently, I am planning to join USF for the MS in BAIS program. I was wondering if my previous application can be used as I have already been accepted, or if I need to reapply. I know the deadline for international students are in February, but as I am already situated in the United States, I do not need extra time for VISA purposes (just the I-20 will suffice if accepted). I really prefer to start in Fall 2023 if there are seats available, but if not then I will look towards Spring 2024. That being said, I hope you can consider my application in the MS in BAIS program. I have already been a part of USF throughout my undergraduate program and have had multiple opportunities working with professors and being a TA, which has helped me grow a lot. Now, I want to join back and pursue my passion in the tech field along with the business values. I have been accepted in a few other schools but my heart belongs to USF. Please let me know if anything can be done or additional information is required from my end. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

I write with a humble request for an application fee waiver for my admission to your distinguished university. As a prospective student hailing from Pakistan, I have been grappling with the ramifications of the current economic situation, which has been marked by an alarming surge in inflation and an unpredictable fluctuation in the rates of the dollar. Regrettably, these circumstances have made it a daunting task for me to manage the expenses associated with application fees for the numerous universities I have applied to. Despite my prudent budgeting, I am dismayed to realize that I am unable to defray the fees for the remaining universities, which necessitates my plea for your compassionate consideration. Permit me to state unequivocally that I am an exceptional candidate, possessing a proven track record of academic excellence, as well as a distinguished set of personal attributes that align seamlessly with the values espoused by your esteemed institution. My academic acumen is exemplified by the successful completion of my Bachelor of Business Administration degree from the University of the People, which is an American accredited university online. Furthermore, my distinguished work as a Relationship Management Executive for Choice Limited, a UK-based MSB company, has conferred upon me an unparalleled professional experience and a richly diversified perspective that would undoubtedly benefit the entire university community. Thus, it is with utmost gratitude that I implore your kindness to consider my request for an application fee waiver, given the exceptional circumstances highlighted earlier. With your indulgence, I assert that I would be a valuable addition to your academic community, committed to making significant contributions to the esteemed institution. Moreover, I would like to seek clarification on whether my credentials are sufficient to exempt me from the English proficiency requirement. Given my proven academic excellence, combined with extensive professional experience, I am confident that my English language proficiency is exemplary and meets the required standards. I, therefore, humbly urge you to consider this fact in your deliberations and provide the necessary exemption. Finally, I would like to inquire about the possibility of being exempt from the GMAT or GRE requirement. My academic background, as well as professional experience, makes me confident that I possess the requisite skills and knowledge to excel in the program. It is my fervent hope that my credentials are satisfactory to merit exemption from this requirement.

I am in particular concerned about QMB 6304 as we are not offering this class in the Spring. There is a ISM 6136 class in the Spring but that is scheduled for the afternoon as well. The best option I can think of at the moment is that you take the QMB 6304 class face-to-face during the Fall (we can move you into the section that accommodates your schedule best) and that we add an online Advanced Systems Analysis and Design class.

My original intent for this program was to take a mix of night and online classes, but clearly, I miscalculated as it's become obvious some of these courses are only offered in person in the morning or afternoon during the week. I just checked with my employer and adjusting my work schedule to accommodate in-person classes at these hours is not feasible. At this point, I see no path forward to pursue the MS in Business Analytics & Information Systems program and my only route is through the Global Master of Science - Business Analytics & Information Systems instead. Do you concur that this is the only viable path given my constraint? (only able to entertain evening or online courses) If so, then it appears I'll have to disenroll from this program and wait until the Summer of 2024 (assuming I get accepted) to start the global version.
